"**Young Forever**" is the fourth song by American hip-hop rapper [Jay-Z](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z) from his album *The Blueprint 3*. 

It is a mild rework of [Alphaville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphaville_%28band%29)'s 1984 song "**Forever Young**":

the original melody is retained, [Mr Hudson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hudson) sings the original lyrics, and Jay-Z raps in place of the verses.

    [Mr. Hudson]
    Let’s dance in style,
    Let’s dance for a while,
    Heaven can wait we’re only watching the skies,
    Hoping for the best but expecting the worst,
    Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
    
    Let us die young or let us live forever,
    We don’t have the power but we never say never,
    Sitting in a sandpit,
    Life is a short trip,
    The music’s for the sad man.
    
    Forever young,
    I wanna be forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever and ever.
    
    Forever young I wanna be,
    Forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever, forever.
    
    [Jay-Z]
    So we live a life like a video,
    When the sun is always out and you never get old,
    And the champagne’s always cold,
    And the music is always good,
    And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood,
    And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass car,
    Without a wrinkle in today,
    Cuz there is no tomorrow,
    Just some picture perfect day,
    To last a whole lifetime,
    And it never ends,
    Cos all we have to do is hit rewind.
    So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,
    Drink some wine,
    Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind,
    Leave a mark that can’t erase neither space nor time.
    So when the director yells cut,
    I’ll be fine,
    I’m forever young...
    
    [Mr. Hudson]
    Forever young,
    I wanna be forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever and ever.
    
    Forever young I wanna be,
    Forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever, forever.
    
    [Jay-Z]
    Fear not when, fear not why,
    Fear not much while were alive,
    Life is for living not living up tight,
    See ya somewhere up in the sky,
    Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye,
    So not for legends, I'm forever young.
    My name shall survive,
    Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,
    Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations,
    While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,
    Shorty, the nigga from here,
    With a little ambition just what we can become here,
    And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,
    Younger kid, younger every year, yeah!
    So if you love me baby this is how you let me know.
    Don’t ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby.
    
    [Mr. Hudson]
    Forever young,
    I wanna be forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever and ever.
    
    Forever young I wanna be,
    Forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever, forever.
    
    [Jay-Z]
    Slamming Bentley doors,
    Hopping out of Porsche’s,
    Popping up on Forbes lists.
    Gorgeous!
    Hold up,
    Niggas thought I lost it,
    They be talking bullshit,
    I be talking more shit.
    They nauseous!
    Hold up,
    I'll be here forever,
    You know, I'm on my fall shit,
    And I ain’t waiting for closure, I will never forfeit,
    Less than four bars,
    Guru bring the chorus in,
    Did you get the picture yet,
    I’m painting you a portrait of young...
    
    [Mr. Hudson]
    Forever young,
    I wanna be forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever and ever.
    
    Forever young I wanna be,
    Forever young,
    Do you really want to live forever?
    Forever, forever.
